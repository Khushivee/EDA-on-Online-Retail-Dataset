# Exploratory Data Analysis on Online Retail Dataset
## Overview

I’m a beginner learning data analysis, and I took this project from the **Coursera Project Network** to understand how data is used in the retail world. Through this project, I wanted to practice using Python for exploring, cleaning, and understanding data. My main goal was to see how data analysis helps in finding useful insights like customer behavior and sales trends.
This project is a small step for me to apply what I’ve learned and build confidence in analyzing real-world data.

## Case Study
In this project, I worked with a dataset from an online retail store that includes details about customer purchases - such as product names, quantities, prices, and dates.
My goal was to explore and analyze this data to understand how the store performs - what products sell the most, which months bring in the highest sales, and who the most valuable customers are.

While doing this, I focused on learning how to find patterns, outliers, and relationships in data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). I also created visualizations to make these insights easier to understand.
Through this case study, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in analyzing real-world data and see how data analysis can help businesses make better decisions and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Objectives
1. To explore and understand the dataset by answering key questions related to sales and customer behavior.

2. To gain insights that can help improve the overall performance of the online retail store.

3. To share data-driven findings and simple recommendations that can support better business decisions.

## Dataset

For this project, I worked with the “Online Retail” dataset, which was provided as part of the **Coursera Project Network**. It contains transactional data from an online retail store between 2010 and 2011. The dataset is in a .xlsx file named Online Retail.xlsx.

The dataset includes the following columns:
InvoiceNo: Invoice number of the transaction
StockCode: Unique code of the product
Description: Description of the product
Quantity: Quantity of the product in the transaction
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product
CustomerID: Unique identifier of the customer
Country: Country where the transaction occurred

This dataset allowed me to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on real-world retail data, helping me learn how to extract meaningful insights as a beginner.
